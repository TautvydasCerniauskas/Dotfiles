# Repository of *Dotfiles*

### This repo stores the essential dotfiles (zshrc tmux.conf vimrc bashrc)

Make.sh file is created to automate the creation process of the dotfiles and new folders which also links the files with the correct dotfiles in the home dir.

If new files needs to be added or move just change line 11 to make it since with others.
